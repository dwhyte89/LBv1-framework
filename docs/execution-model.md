# Execution Model (Conceptual)

LBV1 is designed around controlled task execution.

Principles:
- Logic-first planning
- Optional user confirmation gates
- Explicit authorization for external actions
- Task history logging
- Replay/audit-friendly structure
- Fail-safe override mechanisms

Execution authority is separated from conversational output.
