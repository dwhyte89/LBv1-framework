# Memory Model (Conceptual)

LBV1 uses structured persistent memory with these principles:

- Local-first storage
- Relevance-based recall
- Controlled write operations
- Optional pruning logic
- Encrypted storage design

Memory is isolated from application code.

Instances ship with empty memory state.
