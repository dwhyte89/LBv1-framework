# LBV1 Framework

LBV1 (Light Bringer Version 1) is an offline-first AI operating framework focused on modular cognition, persistent memory, and controlled task execution.

This repository is **documentation-only**. It describes architecture and design principles without exposing production implementation.

## Core Principles
- Offline by default; external providers are optional and gated
- Strict separation of **code / config / data**
- Stable “Core Brain” with a swappable per-user “Persona Layer”
- Controlled task execution with optional confirmation gates
- Auditable behavior via logs and replay-friendly task history

## What’s in this repo
- architecture
- Persona layer concept
- Memory model concept
- Execution model concept
- Roadmap direction

## Status
Active development. Architecture evolving. Core principles locked.

## License
Documentation-only repository. Production system components are proprietary.
